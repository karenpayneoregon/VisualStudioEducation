# Visual Studio shortcuts
Visual Studio provides many shortcuts accessed both from keyboard combinations and/or menu items.

* Visual Studio has different profiles that are setup either when Visual Studio is installed or after the initial installation.
  * Installation of third party products can affect shortcuts and menu items. For example, using Jet Brains [Resharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotnet/?gclid=CjwKCAiAqOriBRAfEiwAEb9oXaBp4XBMON9HbyjtQ7rSXqDplW0cDW9HBqTVxl0Y16jFOg8GJ9XeeRoCS3EQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). 
  * There are several key combinations that will not be affected such as save the current file <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> while [Peek at definition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-view-and-edit-code-by-using-peek-definition-alt-plus-f12?view=vs-2017) <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd> can be different between developers dependent on perferences set which means <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F12</kbd> may be the keyboard shortcut for another developer.

<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd>
